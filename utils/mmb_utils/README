===================================================================

HOW TO INSTALL

Something like
mkdir /usr/local/beeb
cd /usr/local/beeb
tar xvf ..../mmb_utils.tar
ln -s /usr/local/beeb/beeb  /usr/local/bin/beeb

===================================================================

For all the commands that work on MMB files, the default MMB is called
"BEEB.MMB" but this can be changed with "-f otherfile" if used as the
first parameter.

So
  beeb dinfo 2
would do a "*INFO" for all files in image 2 in BEEB.MMB
  beeb dinfo -f other.MMB 2
would do a "*INFO" for all files in image 2 in other.MMB

Other commands that work on normal files do not need "-f" as the first
option because they typically always require an filename (no default)
e.g
  beeb info filename.ssd
  beeb list MYPROG
SSD filenames may be entered as type:filename (eg stl:mydisk.ssd).  See
the following section on BEEB_UTILS_DFS for the meaning of "type".

We never allow disk images in the MMB to be referred to by name; you
must always use the slot number.

One environment variable may be used:
  BEEB_UTILS_DFS
This alters how the catalgue is read.  The format is type:filename
  Default type is Acorn
  Default filename is BEEB.MMB
If there is no : in the value then it is read as a filename with type "acorn"
examples
  stl:/mnt/beeb/beeb.mmb
  /mnt/beeb/beeb.mmb
  watford:

Allowed values for type are
  SOLIDISK  (or STL)
  WATFORD
  OPUS  (or DDOS)  ---- UNTESTED!!
  DISKDOCTOR (or DISCDOCTOR)
  ACORN (same as empty)
What this changes is how the "extra byte" information and extra catalogues
are read.

This value may also be set in $HOME/.beeb_utils_dfs
If the environment variable is set then it overrides the contents of the
file, thus a default may be set but overridden as necessary

Be careful if setting it wrong; eg if reading a Solidisk disk with
a deleted file in the first catalogue then you will see a file with &7F
as the directory if you're not in SOLIDISK mode!

===================================================================
MMB Impacting commands
===================================================================
* daccess
    Does similar to *DLOCK and *DUNLOCK but using "*ACCESS" type syntax
        lock disk 40: beeb daccess 40 L
      unlock disk 40: beeb daccess 40

* dblank_mmb
    Creates blank 128Mb MMB file

* dcat
    Catalogue: Show disk images stored in the MMB

* dget_ssd
    Extracts an SSD from an MMB

* dgetfile
    Extracts all the files from an SSD stored in an MMB
    A few characters are renamed to an _
         :<>|`'/\*?"
    to keep the extracted filename "sane".  The leading "$." is removed
    (other BBC directory names are retained).
    If two files would be extracted with the same name then a -### count is
    added to the end.

    For each file a .inf is also created in the form
      Filename LOAD EXEC [Locked] CRC=####
    The Filename is the original BBC Filename.
    This "inf" file is compatble to the bbcim extraction tool from
    W.H.Scholten

* dform
    Puts a blank SSD onto the MMB.  Allows you to title the disk at the
    same time
      beeb dform 20 NewDisk

* dinfo
    Does an effective *INFO *.* for an SSD stored in an MMB
    (If the disk is multi-catalogue then the catalogue sector is also
     shown)

* dkill
    Marks a disk in a slot as Unformatted  (*DKILL)
    If the optional R flag is passed then it "restores" the image
    (*DRESTORE).
      beeb dkill 10
      beeb dkill 10 R
    A -y flag will force answer "yes" to override locked disks and won't
    ask you if you're sure; use with care
      beeb dkill -y 10

* dlabel
    Changes the label for disk in slot that shows with with *DCAT
    Note: this does not change the SSD title

* donboot
    Shows the current "boot disk" settings, and lets you change them.
    Will not let you set an unformatted disk unless -y flag is used
    eg
      beeb donboot -y 1 300

* dput_ssd
    Writes an SSD to an MMB.  You can't write into a slot that's in
    use (so dkill it first if you want to replace it).  The MMB
    catalogue name for this disk is set to the SSDs name

===================================================================
SSD Impacting commands
===================================================================
Commands that update SSDs (eg delete, access, compact, putfile)
will not work on multi-catalogue disks.  The update commands
are mostly meant to create new SSDs for putting into MMBs.  Read commands
should work on multi-catalogues.

* access
    *ACCESS equivalent
    e.g.
      beeb access mydisk.ssd A.*
      beeb access mydisk.ssd B.* L
    Defaults to '$.' if no directory specified.
    Remember to quote shell characters if necessary!

* blank_ssd
    Creates a new blank 200Kb SSD image

* compact
     *COMPACT equivalent.

* delete
     Deletes files from an SSD. e.g
       beeb delete mydisk.ssd A.TESTFIL
     Multiple filenames can be used.  Directory defaults to '$'.
     We attempt to handle BBC wildcards as well.  e.g.
       beeb delete mydisk.ssd E.*
     It will ask a y/n question for each file before deleting.
     Optional parameter "-y" will skip the asking and will, instead,
     display the files deleted
       beeb delete Foo/RAM_Manager_2.ssd -y E.*
       Deleted E.OE00
       Deleted E.ASM
       Deleted E.CONVERT
       Deleted E.SE00
       Deleted E.E1770
       Deleted E.EXMON

    Remember you might need to quote on the command line to prevent the
    shell doing filename expansion!
      beeb delete Foo/dd.ssd \*

* getfile
    Extracts all the files from an SSD
    See dgetfile for details.

* info
    Does an effective *INFO *.* for an SSD

* merge_dsd
    Will take two SSD image and interleave them into a single DSD image

* opt4
    *OPT4 equivalent

* putfile
    Puts all specified files onto an SSD.
      beeb putfile myssd file1 file2 file3 file4...
    Can use wildcards, eg
      beeb putfile myssd mydir/*
    This will attempt to read .inf files to work out load/exec/locked and
    filename.  If inf file doesn't exist then it'll use the name of the
    file with load/exec values of 0.

    e.g
      % ls -l mydir 
      total 16
      -rw-r--r-- 1 sweh sweh  6 Mar 20 21:12 Test1
      -rw-r--r-- 1 sweh sweh 15 Mar 20 21:12 X.Test2
      -rw-r--r-- 1 sweh sweh 13 Mar 20 21:13 foo
      -rw-r--r-- 1 sweh sweh 39 Mar 20 21:13 foo.inf
    We can see there are three files, but one has a .inf file

      % cat mydir/foo.inf 
      $.FOO   FF1900 FF8023  Locked CRC=AB7A
    This means that "foo" is really called $.FOO
    
    So lets add these to a new SSD
      % beeb blank_ssd myssd
      Blank myssd created
      % beeb putfile myssd mydir/*
      % beeb info myssd
      Disk title:  (1)  Disk size: &320 - 200K
      Boot Option: 0 (None)   File count: 3
      
      Filename: Lck Lo.add Ex.add Length Sct
      $.FOO      L  FF1900 FF8023 00000D 004
      X.Test2       000000 000000 00000F 003
      $.Test1       000000 000000 000006 002
    note that case was preserved, and Test1 was put into $.

    There is an optional -c flag which will *COMPACT the disk before
    adding files.
 
    The SSD is only saved if all the files get added properly.

* rename
    *RENAME
    beeb rename myfile.ssd o.oldname n.newname

* split_dsd
    Will take a DSD image and de-interleave it into two SSD images

* title
    Does an effective *TITLE for an SSD

===================================================================
Utility Programs (file commands)
===================================================================

* beeb
    Simple wrapper so you can do "beeb dcat" or similar.  In this
    way you just need to symlink this "beeb" program into your PATH
    (eg $HOME/bin) and that's it.

    You may need to set the one variable in the file:
      # $INSTALL_DIR="/where/you/installed/the/program";
    if the program can't work out the symlink target properly

    In good BBC style, a "." will act as a wildcard.  So "beeb i."
    might match "beeb info".  If multiple commands might match then an
    "Ambiguous" error message is returned.

* dump
    *DUMP

* list
    Lists a basic program. 
       "-o #" applies LISTO options
       "-t XXX" uses the XXX decoder
           basic2 == BASIC 2 (default)
           basic4 == BASIC 4
           z80 == BASIC 4 for Z80
           arm == BASIC from the Arc
           b4w == BASIC for Windows
    eg
      beeb list myfile -o 7
     (Extra LISTO option "8" adds a space after each token)

    If you want a prettier lister (eg html, colour etc) then bbclist
      from W.H.Scholten produces nice output.

* type
    *TYPE (converts BBC to Unix line endings)

===================================================================
Disk format
===================================================================
MMB consists of 32 sectors (8Kb) of data, split into 16 byte blocks.
The first block of 8 chars is is in the format
 aa bb cc dd AA BB CC DD
where AAaa BBbb CCcc DDdd are the images inserted at boot time.  Default
is 00 01 02 03 00 00 00 00
"*ONBOOT 3 500" would make dd=F4 DD=01  (&01F4=500)

The next 8 bytes (completing the 16 byte block) are unused and are
typically all zero.

After that comes 511 blocks which consist of
  DISKNAME(12 chars)
  unused (3 chars)
  STATUS(1 char)  0 ==> locked (readonly); 15=>Readwrite; 240=>Unformatted
                 255 => invalid

In theory the DISKNAME should match the disk TITLE in each place, but it
can get out of sync.  *RECAT on the MMC Utils ROM reads the title from
each SSD and updates this name.

Then each SSD is a chunk of 200Kb data following.  So disk 'n' starts
at 'n'*204800+8192.  That's all there is to an MMB.

An SSD is a simple 200K (80track 10 sector) image.  Since it's literally
an image it follows the standard Acorn DFS layout.

Sector 0 is split into 32 * 8byte records.  Record 0 is the first 8
characters of the disk title.  Records 1->31 have filename (7 chars)
and directory(1 char).  If the high bit of the directory is set then
the file is locked.

Sector 1 is similarly split into 32*8 bytes but a lot more complicated.
Bytes 0->3 are the last 4 characters of the disk title.  The title is NULL
  terminated if it's shorter than 12 chars.
Byte 4 is (BCD) the "write cycle".  In theory every write should update
  that, but really... who cares?
Byte 5 is "number of files"*8
Byte 6: bits 4 and 5 encode the "*OPT 4" value
        bits 0 and 1 are the high bits for "number of sectors"
Byte 7 is the low 8 bits of "number of sectors"

Now for a "double density" disk, you need 11 bits to encode the disk
size, so Solidisk and others used byte 6 bit 2 (unused) for this.
This code will always assume this bit is part of the sector size.

See "Solidisk chained catalgues" (below) for a minor variation on this.

Now we have the remaining 31 records, which match file equivalent
files in sector 0.  They are laid out like this:
  LL LL EE EE SS SS XX YY
where "LLLL" is the load address, "EEEE" is the exec address, "SSSS" is
the size, and "YY" is the start sector.  "XX" is the fun one.
  bits 0+1 are high bits of sector start
  bits 2+3 are high bits of load address
  bits 4+5 are high bits of size
  bits 6+7 are high bits of exec address

That makes 10 bits for start sector and 18 bits for size.

But on a 320K disk you need 11 bits for stat sector and 19 bits for size.
So Solidisk steals bits 2 and 3 ("load address").  bit 2 is added to the
sector, bit 3 to the size.  This means we have now only have 8 bits for
the load address.  So, by trial and error (and disk sector editing -
Solidisk DDFS comes with *DZAP :-)) I found that Solidisk reuses the
high bits of the "exec" address as the high bits of the "load" address.


Solidisk chained catalogues
---------------------------
Solidisk also has the concept of "chained catalogues".  If
byte 2 & 192 == 192 then the low nibble of byte 2 and byte 3 point to
the next catalogue, where another 30 files might be stored.

So looking at a hex dump of the first 8 bytes of sector 1:
  00000100  00 00 C0 21 35 F8 03 20   ...!5.. 

You'll notice &102 and &103 have odd values in them.  We can see that
&102 AND 192 == 192 so &102 AND 63 and &103 point to the next
catalogue.  In this case we have a second catalogue at sector &021.
Yes, this means disk titles are be limited to 10 characters.

And here it is:
00002100  3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F   ????????
00002108  46 49 4C 45 36 30 20 24   FILE60 $
00002110  46 49 4C 45 35 39 20 24   FILE59 $

Obviously the "title" doesn't mean anything in secondary catalogues!

We note a funky entry in the 2nd catalogue:
000021f8  3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F BF   ???????.
and its associated data:
000022f8  00 00 00 00 00 21 00 02   .....!..

Basically this an "invisible" file that pretends to fill up the disk from
sector 2 to where this new catalogue starts.  It's a cheap kludge so that
programs like *COMPACT can work on this catalogue without worrying about
what is before.  Everything in earlier catalogues is now frozen.  So what
happens if you delete or change a file in an earlier catalogue?  That
value gets marked "deleted", thus:
  000000a8  46 49 4C 45 31 30 20 FF   FILE10 .
(Basically the directory is set to &FF).  The space isn't reclaimed, but
DDFS now ignores it.

Looking, again at the 2nd catalogue, at the "data" sector:
00002200  00 21 C0 41 30 F8 03 20   .!.A0.. 
Oops, a third catalog at sector &41.  This follows the same pattern, but
we get:
000041d0  46 49 4C 45 36 32 20 24   FILE62 $
000041d8  46 49 4C 45 36 31 20 24   FILE61 $
000041e0  3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F BF   ???????.
000041e8  3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F 3F   ????????

Ah ha, the locked ?.??????? entry is the locked file again, and all entries
after that are just ?.??????? because they haven't been used yet.  This
means that the locked ?.??????? entry is a good "end of catalogue" marker
because it'll always be the first entry written (so the last in the sector)
when a 2ndary catalogue is created.

===================================================================
OPUS DDOS
===================================================================

Opus does things differently to everyone else.  It's a little bizarre,
but...

Basically, for a double-density disk (only!) they split the drive into
sub-drives.  Drive 0 is really split into drive 0A to 0H.  Now some of
these drives may be of zero length and so empty.  Each of these drives
can be a maximum of 252K in size (&3F0 sectors).  See what they did
there?  They avoided the whole problem of handling sector sizes over
2^10 long, or file sizes over 2^18 long so the catalogues are Acorn
standard.  To add more space, the catalogues actually live outside
of the "drive", so files in the drive are allocated from sector zero.

Now an Opus disk is 18 sectors per track, and allocations are done
per track.

Track 0
  Sector  0, 1 : catalogue A
  Sector  2, 3 : catalogue B
  Sector  4, 5 : catalogue C
  Sector  6, 7 : catalogue D
  Sector  8, 9 : catalogue E
  Sector 10,11 : catalogue F
  Sector 12,13 : catalogue G
  Sector 14,15 : catalogue H
  Sector    16 : Disk allocation table
  Sector    17 : unused
Tracks 1 to 79 are the data.

The disk allocation table is small.  http://beebwiki.jonripley.com/Opus_DDOS
has some details, but #4 doesn't seem to match.  We see that bytes 1,2,3,4
allow for different format of disks (eg 40 track, 35 track) and even
different densities.  But the standard 80-track double density disk will
be as follows:
    byte 0: &20
  byte 1,2: disk size (&5A0)
    byte 3: sector per track (&12)
    byte 4: &50  (but I've also seen &FF in testing!)
  byte  8, 9: track start for A
  byte 10,11: track start for B
  byte 12,13: track start for C
  byte 14,15: track start for D
  byte 16,17: track start for E
  byte 18,19: track start for F
  byte 20,21: track start for G
  byte 22,23: track start for H
So
  00001000  20 05 A0 12 50 00 00 00    ...P...
  00001008  01 00 39 00 00 00 00 00   ..9.....
  00001010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ........
  00001018  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ........
We have two disks (A, starting at track 1, and B, starting at track &39).
The other disks are not defined.

This is wasteful of data (a whole unused sector!) but given we have 360K
of data rather than 200K of the original Acorn format, I guess Opus figured
this was a fair trade off.
